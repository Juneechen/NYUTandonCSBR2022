# NYU Tandon Bridge Program - Spring 2022 (17 weeks)

## Program Overview
The Bridge course is a single non-credit certificate course that is equivalent to 400 hours of learning and more than three courses containing topics in Computer Programming in C++, Object Oriented Design, Discrete Math, Data Structures and Algorithms, Principles of Operating Systems, and Introduction to Computer Networks.

## Program Objectives
By the end of the CS Bridge Program students should have:
1. Basic understanding of how data is represented and how computers execute instructionsto use and modify data in order to solve problems.
2. Understanding of computational thinking: how to develop algorithms using decisions,repetition, and decomposition into manageable components to solve problems.
3. Ability to implement and test moderate sized programs in C++, using constructsincluding variables, operators, decision statements, loops, functions, and built-in datatypes.
4. Ability to understand basic object-oriented programming concepts.
5. Ability to code, use, analyze the performance of, and modify fundamental data structures.
6. Have a firm understanding of operating systems topics related to processes, threads,thread concurrency, deadlocks, and memory management.
7. Understanding of fundamental concepts in discrete math
